# 🎬 Netflix Clone UI

This project is a fully responsive **Netflix-inspired user interface** built using HTML and CSS (with plans for future React integration). It's a front-end-only clone that mimics the look and feel of Netflix's landing page, complete with a responsive navbar, subscription form, promo section, trending carousel, more-cards section, FAQ, and footer.

> ✅ Created as part of UI/UX skill-building for front-end development and freelancing portfolio.
